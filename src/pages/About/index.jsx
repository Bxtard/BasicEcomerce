        My name is Bryan Estrada. Iâ€™m a fullstack developer with strong knowledge in React, TypeScript, JS, Mongodb, Express, among others. I consider that I am very good at algorithms, beacause to this day, I have not been presented with a challenge that I can not really accomplish with effort and perseverance. I can easily and quickly adapt to the structure of a new programming language. I really enjoy learning about programming topics.I never tire of learning more about computer systems and network functions. I am very good at problem solving, because I really love puzzles and every activity that makes me exercise my brain. I love teamwork and share knowledge with others.
